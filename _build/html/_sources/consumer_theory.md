# Consumer Theory

Consider a consumer who, in a particular period, spends their entire income on just two things:food and fuel. For simplicity, we assume that only this period matters, i.e., the consumer does notthink about the future, and money has no value in itself. This simple model can easily be gener-alised to more products, but it then becomes hard to draw pictures. Since we are often interestedin markets for particular products, we might group all other products into a composite good thatrepresents everything else. The simple two-dimensional examples below can then still be used,with one good being the good of interest, and the other good representing a composite good called“everything else” - you’d still only spend your money on these two things. The models can also begeneralised to include more time periods, but this is beyond the scope of this course.

## The budget constraint

Our consumer can spend her money on food, fuel, or a combination of both. A particular combina-tion of goods, in this case, a combination of some units of fuel and some units of food, is called abasket or bundle. She cannot spend more then her income (= her budget). We can visualise this bydrawing a budget constraint, as in the diagram below. Our consumer can spend her entire incomeon fuel (in which case she can buy a maximum of BudgetPrice per unit of fuel units of fuel), her entire income onfood (in which case she can buy a maximum of BudgetPrice per unit of food units of food), or a combination ofthe two. She can afford any basket on the budget constraint or below it.

## Indifference curves

o far, we have only looked at the combinations of goods the consumer can choose. We now need adescription of the consumer’s preferences to predict which particular one she will choose. We canvisualise a consumer’s preferences using indifference curves
