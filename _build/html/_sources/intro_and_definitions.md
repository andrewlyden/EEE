# What is economics?

Economics is the study of how people and societies make choices to satisfy their needs and wants with limited resources. This course will focus on **microeconomics**, and only touches on macroeconomics which is the branch of economics that focuses on the study of the overall economy, including factors like inflation, unemployment, economic growth, and government policies, rather than individual markets or specific economic units.

Microeconomics is a branch of economics that focuses on the study of individual economic units at a small scale, such as households, businesses, consumers, and specific markets. It examines the behavior of these economic agents and how they make decisions regarding the allocation of resources, production, consumption, and pricing of goods and services.

Key topics and concepts in microeconomics include:

1. Supply and Demand: Microeconomics analyzes the interactions between the supply of goods and services by producers and the demand for them by consumers. The equilibrium price and quantity in a market are determined by these interactions.

2. Consumer Behavior: Microeconomics examines how individuals and households make choices about what to consume, considering factors like preferences, budget constraints, and utility maximization.

3. Producer Behavior: It investigates how businesses and firms make decisions about production, including cost minimization, profit maximization, and output levels.

4. Market Structures: Microeconomics categorizes markets into different structures, such as perfect competition, monopolistic competition, oligopoly, and monopoly, and studies how market structure influences pricing, competition, and behavior.

5. Elasticity: Elasticity measures the responsiveness of the quantity demanded or supplied to changes in prices or other factors. It helps to understand how sensitive consumers and producers are to price changes.

6. Resource Allocation: Microeconomics delves into the efficient allocation of resources, including land, labor, and capital, to maximize economic welfare and productivity.

7. Externalities: Externalities are the effects of economic activities that spill over to affect third parties who are not involved in the transaction. Microeconomics explores the role of externalities in markets and their impact on efficiency.

8. Public Goods: Public goods are non-excludable and non-rivalrous goods that often require government intervention to ensure provision, as private markets may under-produce them.

9. Market Failures: Microeconomics identifies instances where markets may not lead to efficient outcomes, leading to market failures. These failures can result from imperfect competition, information asymmetry, and other factors.

Microeconomics is concerned with understanding the behavior of individual economic agents, how they interact in markets, and how government policies can influence these interactions. It forms the foundation for making decisions related to resource allocation, pricing, and public policy, and it is an essential component of the broader field of economics.

# What is energy economics?

Energy economics is a specialized field within economics that deals with the production, consumption, and allocation of energy resources and their impact on the economy. It involves the study of various aspects related to energy, including the pricing of energy sources, energy markets, energy policy, energy sustainability, and the economic consequences of energy-related decisions. Energy economics examines how societies generate, distribute, and use energy, and it explores the economic implications of different energy sources and technologies, as well as the environmental and social impacts of energy production and consumption. This field plays a crucial role in addressing global challenges such as energy security, environmental sustainability, and the transition to cleaner and more efficient energy systems.

# What is environmental economics?

Environmental economics is a specialized field within economics that examines the intricate interplay between human economic activities and their consequences for the natural environment. It delves into how decisions related to production, consumption, resource allocation, and policies can lead to environmental impacts, both positive and negative. Additionally, it considers how environmental factors, such as climate change, pollution, and resource scarcity, affect economic choices and outcomes. Environmental economists employ various tools, including cost-benefit analysis and valuation techniques, to assess the trade-offs and externalities associated with environmental decisions. This field is crucial for addressing pressing global concerns like sustainability, resource conservation, and the design of effective environmental policies.
