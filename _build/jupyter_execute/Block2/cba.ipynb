    "A key idea in finance is the time value of money, which means that having money now is more valuable than having it in the future. You'd prefer to have £100 right away than wait for it. Now, think about it from the other side. What if I owed you money and I really wanted to delay paying you back? To make up for your preference for getting money sooner, I would have to pay you more than what I owed. This extra payment to make up for the time delay is called interest. There's also another aspect to consider—risk. If you had concerns about whether I could pay you back in the future, you might charge me even more interest to cover that risk."

You give some money to the bank, and in return, they pay you for letting them use your money to invest in different things. What they pay you is called interest, and it's usually shown as a percentage of the money you put in—this percentage is called the interest rate. So, if you deposit £1 in the bank and the interest rate is 5%, you'll get £0.05 in interest.\n",

If you earn some interest in one year, in the next year, you not only earn interest on the original amount you put in but also on the interest you earned before. This idea is called compounding interest. We can figure out how much £1 will be worth in $x$ number of years when it's compounding a $n$ number of times each year at a specific interest rate.\n",

    "Present value is a financial concept that calculates the current worth of future cash flows by considering factors such as the expected cash flows, the time period over which they will be received, and a discount rate. The present value is calculated by taking the future money you expect to get from an investment and bringing it back to today. To do this calculation you need three things: first, you need to know how much money you expect to get (we call this the expected cash flows); second, you need to know how many years you'll be getting that money for; and third, you need a discount rate. If the discount rate is high, it makes the present value lower, and if it's low, it makes the present value higher. Bringing these together you can use this forumla:\n",

    "Broadly speaking all generation costs can be categorized into two groups depending on the point in time at which those costs are incurred: at the time of the investment decision or at the time of the production decision. The costs associated with the investment decision are usually called fixed or investment costs and the costs incurred only at the time of generation are called variable or generation costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fixed costs** are the cost of equipment, land, financing, project management, grid connection, and construction of the power plant. These are usually expressed per unit of installed capacity (per kW or per MW). Fixed costs are regarded as “sunk costs”, because once the plant is erected and fixed costs are incurred they cannot be recuperated. The plant may be sold or scrapped at some point but such a transaction usually yields only insignificant revenue.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Variable costs** consist of fuel cost, operation and maintenance expenses and carbon dioxide emission charges, if applicable. They are typically calculated per unit of electricity generated (per MWh). Only variable costs play a role when it is necessary to decide whether to use an existing plant to produce electricity or not. Fixed costs are irrelevant to this production decision for the precise reason that they are sunk. For the investment decision, in contrast, both fixed and variable costs matter, as we will see further on.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Quasi-fixed costs**. There is a third category that lies between fixed and variable costs, sometimes called quasi-fixed costs, which includes cost of labor; staff can be hired or fired after the investment decision at discrete points in time but not for every single production decision. In electricity generation, such quasi-fixed costs are small enough not to merit separate treatment and are subsumed in variable costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cost structure of generation technologies**. Electricity generation technologies vary dramatically in their cost structure. Some plants, such as nuclear, wind and solar power, have virtually zero variable costs: once they are built, they produce electricity virtually for free. This is in stark contrast to fossil fuel-based power plants. For example, variable costs (fuel costs and emission charges) comprise approximately 40% of the total costs of a coal-fired power station and as much as 60% of a gas-fired combined cycle plant. In general technologies with low CO2 emissions, which tend to be the technologies that use no fuel, are also those where fixed costs make up a higher percentage of total costs."

To this end, fixed and variable costs be meaningfully combined into one single metric.\n",

    "**LCOE**. A cost metric that is frequently used for this purpose is the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE), also called the levelized energy costs (LEC).
