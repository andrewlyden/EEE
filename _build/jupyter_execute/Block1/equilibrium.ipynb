    "A market is perfectly competitive if no single consumer or producer can influence prices on their own (we say that, in this case, there is no market power, or that everybody is a price taker). In practice, this is likely to happen if there are a large number of firms selling an identical product to a large number of consumers, in a market where everybody has perfect information (i.e. know prices everywhere), without any externalities (negative/positive effects of production/consumption that are not born by the producer/consumer). In this case, a producer or consumer cannot influence the price by producing or consuming more or less - everybody is such a small part of the market that this will not change anything. Can you think of example products where the market might approach perfect competition?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the equilibrium price and quantity can be found at the intersection of the supply and demand curve. It should be easy to see why: if a producer produces an incrementally small amount more, its costs (the height of the supply curve) will be higher than the price, so this is not worth doing. If a producer produces an incrementally small amount less, its lost revenues (the price) will be higher than the costs saved (the height of the supply curve).\n",
    "\n",
    "In a perfectly competitive equilibrium, social surplus, or social welfare (the sum of producer and consumer surplus) will be maximised - i.e., even though everybody selfishly chooses how much to produce, the total value of the market to producer and consumer is at its optimum. Again, it should be easy to see why. If we produce more than the equilibrium, the costs of doing this (the height of the supply curve) exceeds the consumer's utility from the additional amount produced (the height of the demand curve). If we produce less, we can increase social welfare since the consumers' utility of getting an additional unit is still higher than the cost of producing this unit.\n",

In the diagram below, a perfectly competitive equilibrium is plotted (assuming linear curves). Experiment with the parameters.

    "A producer has a monopoly if it is the only one producing a particular product. Can you think of markets for which this is the case? In this case, the monopolist has market power (it is a price maker) because, if it increases or decreases its production, it changes prices. In particular, by decreasing the quantity it produces, it can create more scarcity, increasing the price. The equilibrium between supply and demand is now not at the intersection between the demand and supply curves. To see why, use the diagram below. See what happens if you increase or decrease the quantity produced. What is the profit (=producer surplus)-maximising quantity? How does this depend on the slopes of the demand and supply curves? NB: if you increase the monopoly quantity above the perfectly competitive equilibrium, visualising the producer surplus becomes difficult as there is a loss."

    "You have (hopefully) seen that the monopolist would choose a quantity where the supply curve intersects the blue dot-dashed line. This is the marginal revenue function which, when supply and demand curves are linear, is twice as steep as the demand curve. To see where this comes from, we have to do a bit of mathematics. A monopolist sets a quantity such that its marginal revenue (the revenue from producing an additional unit) is equal to its marginal cost (the cost of producing an additional unit). If these two are not equal, it can still increase its profits. Marginal costs are, as we have seen, given by the supply curve. Total revenues (the amount of money coming in) are (price × quantity) where the price is given by the inverse demand function (price = demand intercept + demand slope × quantity). Putting these two together, total revenues are given by TR = price × quantity = (demand intercept + demand slope x quantity) × quantity = demand intercept × quantity + demand slope × quantity2 Hence, marginal revenues (the additional amount of money coming in if the producer makes another unit) are D[TR]\n",

For which demand/supply slopes/intercepts do consumers suffer most/least from being in a monopolistic market, as opposed to the perfectly competitive market above? What would happen if we shift the supply curve up or down in a parallel way (e.g., if we gave the producer a per-unit subsidy or imposed a tax)? For which parameters would consumers/the monopolist benefit most? Remember to optimise the quantity every time you change the intercepts/slopes. What if we shift the demand curve up or down (e.g, by increasing or reducing value-added taxes)?"

    "Most markets are neither perfectly competitive nor monopolies. Instead, there are usually a number (but not an infinite number) of firms that supply a product. In this case, the market is an oligopoly. At this point, we have to consider the nature of competition. In some markets, producers can be assumed to choose prices. Quantities are then a consequence of the prices that everybody charges, as well as the demand curve. This is called Bertrand competition. In other markets, it is more natural to think of producers as choosing quantities. In this case, prices are then a consequence of the quantities all producers choose, and the demand curve. This is called Cournot competition. An often-cited example are air travel markets, where the important initial choice facing airlines is the number of seats they will offer in a market; after all airlines have chosen this, a market-clearing price can be calculated. Energy markets are also usually thought of as Cournot markets. Finally, sometimes some producers are market leaders, who get to make their decisions before others, instead of everybody making decisions at the same time. In this case, we have Stackelberg competition."

    "Bertrand oligopolies are easy to model. As long as consumers have perfect information about the prices that all producers charge, they will buy from the producer with the lowest price. This means that a producer can capture the entire market by choosing a price that is just a little bit lower than its competitors. Of course, its competitors know this, so will also try to undercut. This leads to a race to the bottom. Producers will not be willing to sell products below their costs, so a producer will set its production to zero if it reaches its cost of production. Once there are only two producers left, with one having reached its cost of production, the second one has no incentive to further reduce its price. The price in a Bertrand oligopoly is therefore the production cost of the second-cheapest producer. All remaining producers will charge this price. If all producers have a constant marginal cost, only two producers will produce. If both producers have equal marginal costs, the price will be equal to what it would be under perfect competition. If producers have quadratic total cost curves (i.e. linear marginal cost curves) or above, more than two producers might be active. Since energy markets are not usually modelled as Bertrand oligopolies, we will not analyse this setting in detail."
