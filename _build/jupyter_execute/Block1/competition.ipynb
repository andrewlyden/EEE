    "A market is perfectly competitive if no single consumer or producer can influence prices on their own (we say that, in this case, there is no market power, or that everybody is a price taker). In practice, this is likely to happen if there are a large number of firms selling an identical product to a large number of consumers, in a market where everybody has perfect information (i.e. know prices everywhere), without any externalities (negative/positive effects of production/consumption that are not born by the producer/consumer). In this case, a producer or consumer cannot influence the price by producing or consuming more or less - everybody is such a small part of the market that this will not change anything. Can you think of example products where the market might approach perfect competition?\n",

It should be easy to see why: if a producer produces an incrementally small amount more, its costs (the height of the supply curve) will be higher than the price, so this is not worth doing. If a producer produces an incrementally small amount less, its lost revenues (the price) will be higher than the costs saved (the height of the supply curve).\n",

Again, it should be easy to see why. If we produce more than the equilibrium, the costs of doing this (the height of the supply curve) exceeds the consumer's utility from the additional amount produced (the height of the demand curve). If we produce less, we can increase social welfare since the consumers' utility of getting an additional unit is still higher than the cost of producing this unit.\n",

    "Marginal cost of production refers to the additional cost incurred by a firm in producing one more unit of a good or service. It is the extra cost associated with increasing the level of output by a single unit. Mathematically, marginal cost is calculated as the change in total cost divided by the change in quantity, expressed as:\n",

    "    \\text{Mariginal cost} = \\frac{\\Delta \\text{Total cost}}{\\Delta \\text{Quantity}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In practical terms, marginal cost often includes variable costs like raw materials, labor, and energy, but it excludes fixed costs, which do not change with the level of production in the short run. The concept of marginal cost is crucial for firms in making production decisions. In a perfectly competitive market, where firms are price takers, they will typically produce at a level where marginal cost equals the market-determined price to maximize their profits. If the marginal cost is less than the market price, the firm can increase its profit by producing more, and if it is higher, the firm may reduce production to avoid losses. \n",
    "\n",
    "In perfect competition, where firms aim to maximise profits, setting the price equal to marginal cost ensures efficiency and allocative optimality. This is because, in the long run, firms that set prices above the marginal cost would lose customers to competitors offering a lower price. Conversely, firms setting prices below marginal cost would find it unsustainable. Therefore, in perfect competition, the equality between marginal cost and price prevails, leading to an efficient allocation of resources and optimal outcomes for both producers and consumers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In consumer theory, marginal pricing plays a role in your decisions as a buyer. Imagine you're deciding whether to buy one more unit of a product. The marginal utility, or the extra satisfaction you get from that extra unit, bumps into the marginal price, affecting your decision on whether it's worth it. \n",
    "- In producer theory it's about making one more unit of a product and considering the cost involved. This is the marginal cost â€“ the extra cost of producing one more unit. Producers use marginal pricing to figure out the sweet spot where the cost of making more aligns with the revenue they'll get.\n",
    "- In a competitive market, where many players are vying for your business, the interaction between marginal cost and revenue is crucial. Marginal pricing guides producers in deciding how much to produce to maximize their profits, playing a crucial role in keeping markets balanced."

In particular, by decreasing the quantity it produces, it can create more scarcity, increasing the price. The equilibrium between supply and demand is now not at the intersection between the demand and supply curves. To see why, use the diagram below. See what happens if you increase or decrease the quantity produced. What is the profit (=producer surplus)-maximising quantity? How does this depend on the slopes of the demand and supply curves?

A monopolist sets a quantity such that its marginal revenue (the revenue from producing an additional unit) is equal to its marginal cost (the cost of producing an additional unit).

For which parameters would consumers/the monopolist benefit most? Remember to optimise the quantity every time you change the intercepts/slopes.

    "Most markets are neither perfectly competitive nor monopolies. Instead, there are usually a number (but not an infinite number) of firms that supply a product. In this case, the market is an oligopoly. At this point, we have to consider the nature of competition. In some markets, producers can be assumed to choose prices. Quantities are then a consequence of the prices that everybody charges, as well as the demand curve. This is called Bertrand competition. In other markets, it is more natural to think of producers as choosing quantities. In this case, prices are then a consequence of the quantities all producers choose, and the demand curve. This is called Cournot competition. An often-cited example are air travel markets, where the important initial choice facing airlines is the number of seats they will offer in a market; after all airlines have chosen this, a market-clearing price can be calculated. Energy markets are also usually thought of as Cournot markets. Finally, sometimes some producers are market leaders, who get to make their decisions before others, instead of everybody making decisions at the same time. In this case, we have Stackelberg competition."

    "Bertrand oligopolies are easy to model. As long as consumers have perfect information about the prices that all producers charge, they will buy from the producer with the lowest price. This means that a producer can capture the entire market by choosing a price that is just a little bit lower than its competitors. Of course, its competitors know this, so will also try to undercut. This leads to a race to the bottom. Producers will not be willing to sell products below their costs, so a producer will set its production to zero if it reaches its cost of production. Once there are only two producers left, with one having reached its cost of production, the second one has no incentive to further reduce its price. The price in a Bertrand oligopoly is therefore the production cost of the second-cheapest producer. All remaining producers will charge this price. If all producers have a constant marginal cost, only two producers will produce. If both producers have equal marginal costs, the price will be equal to what it would be under perfect competition. If producers have quadratic total cost curves (i.e. linear marginal cost curves) or above, more than two producers might be active. Since energy markets are not usually modelled as Bertrand oligopolies, we will not analyse this setting in detail."

    "Consumers can also have market power. This is less common, but there are plenty of examples of markets with only a small number of large consumers. Think, for instance, about markets for specialist medical equipment, computing parts, or manufacturing equipment. If there is only one consumer for a product (but potentially a large number of producers) this is called a monopsony. If there are several, this is an oligopsoly. Since these are not very common, and have less relevance to energy/environmental markets, we will not discuss them in detail here.\n"

    "So far, we have only looked at short-term decision making (i.e. assuming that the number of competitors is fixed). In reality, producers can usually choose to leave a market if they are making losses. Similarly, producers can enter if there are profits to be made, although there might be barriers to entry/exit, such as high fixed costs involved in setting yourself up as a new producer, or regulatory constraints. Hence, monopolies might evolve into oligopolies or perfectly competitive markets. Long-run profits are equal to the short-term producer profits minus fixes costs. We will discuss this later when we look at energy market examples."
