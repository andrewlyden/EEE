# Welcome

Welcome to Energy & Environmental Economics! Through this course, you will get a basic understanding of key microeconomic theories, the way energy markets function, and the economic aspects of environmental problems. This website accompanies the material available on Learn.

This course consists of three blocks. The first will give you an introduction to (mainly micro-) economic theory. The second will use these theories and apply them to environmental problems. The third applies economic theory to energy markets.

Learn is where any changes or other announcements will be published, so check the Learn page regularly and/or set up email notifications of changes.
