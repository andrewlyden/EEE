    "This the the first week of Block 1 on environmental economics which is about using economic ideas to understand and deal with environmental issues. A central idea in environmental economics is that the environment has intrinsic value to people which isn't always accounted for in simpler market-based approaches to economics. These unaccounted costs are called market failures and have negative effects. They are termed **externalities** and will be explored on this page.\n",
    "\n",
    "The greatest single example of a negative externality of global importance is the emission of greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide) from the combustion of hydrocarbons (coal, gasoline, diesel, oil). The true cost of this isn't intrinsically included in the formation of prices and quantities we have explored in consumer, producer, and competition theory. This means we end up with higher quantities consumed than is **socially optimal**. Environmental economists try to figure out how can we reduce quantities consumed to what's best for everyone, and weigh the pros and cons of doing that.\n",
    "\n",
    "A lot of the work in this field is about creating tools to internalise the externalities. The tools can be split into two types:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Command and Control: The government puts limits on pollution to control the problem. For example, they might tell each company they can only emit a certain amount of greenhouse gases.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Market-based: The government sets a goal for emissions and then gives incentives or subsidies to change how businesses act. Each business decides how much to emit.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section will focus on market-based solutions: a **carbon tax** and **tradeable permits**."

    "Most environmental problems are caused by externalities. These are costs (or benefits) that are a result of production or consumption that do not go to the producer/consumer, and are therefore\n",
    "not taken into account by producers or consumers when they make decisions about which quantities to buy or sell. Externalities are production externalities if they are a consequence of production (e.g., carbon emissions if these are not priced or taxed, local air pollution that is a direct consequence of production, water pollution from discharge of waste water, etc.).  Consumption externalities are consequences of consumption (e.g., plastic pollution resulting from consumers disposing of packaging material inappropriately, etc.). Positive externalities occur when production or consumption has positive benefits to someone else in society that are not taken into account by the producer or consumer (e.g., using bees to pollinate crops can have benefits to others around; choosing to vaccinate yourself has benefits to society because you are less likely to infect others, etc). Negative externalities are probably more common (e.g., pollution).\n",
    "\n",
    "If a production externality occurs, the supply function does not capture the full social cost of production, but only the private cost to the producers. Sticking with perfect competition for simplicity, we can amend the standard supply/demand diagram by adding an additional social marginal cost function which if higher (if there are negative production externalities) or lower (if there are positive production externalities) than the supply function, which is the private marginal cost function. The difference between the private and social marginal cost curves is the size of the externality; the marginal external cost. In most cases, including most pollution scenarios, the marginal external cost increases with production - the higher the level of pollution already is, the worse an additional unit is, but this depends on the externality in question. In the diagram below, we assume a (linearly) increasing marginal external cost of £0.01 x quantity (i.e., if 100 units are being produced, the last one has an external cost of £1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since producers (and consumers) do not take the external cost into account, the market, if unregulated, will still reach equilibrium at the intersection between the demand and supply ( = private marginal cost) curve. However, at that point, the quantity produced and consumed is not socially optimal. In the diagram, since there is a negative production externality, the social cost of producting the last unit is higher than the social benefit (in this case, since there are no consumption externalities, the benefit to consumers, e.t. the height of the demand curve). The social optimum is instead at the intersection of the demand curve and the social marginal cost curve, which lies at a smaller quantity and higher price. The externality therefore causes social surplus to be lower than optimal. We call this loss a deadweight loss, as it is a loss that is not compensated for by something else. The size of the deadweight loss is indicated in the figure - it is the difference between the social cost of production and the consumer benefit (the demand curve) between the optimal and market equilibria, i.e., the amount of additional cost to society, over and above the benefit consumers derive from obtaining the product minus the private costs of production. When calculating social surplus, we have to subtract this deadweight loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "Experiment using the diagram below. When is the deadweight loss large? When is it negligible? Do you understand why this is the case?"

    "Since externalities imply that the market equilibrium does not lead to the maximum social welfare, there is a potential for policy to increase welfare. There are a number of ways to do this, and how they work depend on whether it is possible to address the cause of the externality (e.g., whether it is possible to change production processes to bring the marginal external cost curve itself down) or whether it is only possible to reduce quantities produced. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will analyse the second case with a different set of models, but in this notebook, we focus on a case where the marginal external cost curve cannot be changed - i.e., production is unavoidably linked to pollution. In this case, we will still like to make sure that social welfare is maximised. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can do this with taxation that internalises the externality, i.e. makes the producers pay for their pollution and therefore bringing the external costs into their optimisation problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, ideally, we’d like to increase the private marginal cost curve such that it matches the social marginal cost curve. Hower, in practice, it is usually difficult to set tax rates that vary with the level of production (and therefore also vary across producers, if there are multiple). Constant per-unit taxes are much easier - these would force producers to pay a fixed amount for each unit they produce, and therefore shift the supply curve straight up, without changing its slope. The good news is that this can still achieve the social optimum if we set the tax rate correctly. Using the diagram below, experiment with the tax rate (if you choose a negative value for the tax, this is effectively setting a subsidy). When is the social optimum achieved? (i.e. when is the deadweight loss eliminated?). Why?"

    "**Basics:**\n",
    "Pollution permits are like official rights that companies get to release a certain amount of pollutants. If a company pollutes less than its permit allows, it can sell the extra permit to another company. But if it pollutes more, it has to buy extra permits from other companies or the government. This creates a market where the price of permits depends on how much companies want them.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How Pollution Permits Work Over Time:**\n",
    "Imagine there's a fixed supply of permits. If more companies want them because of economic growth, the cost of permits goes up. If the government reduces the number of permits over time, companies have to pay more, creating an incentive for them to find cleaner technologies and reduce pollution gradually.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pollution Permits and Social Efficiency:**\n",
    "When companies produce pollution, it's like a side effect of their production. Pollution permits help fix this by making companies pay for the social cost of pollution. This is important because, in a free market, companies might produce too much pollution, causing problems for everyone.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pollution Permits vs Carbon Tax:**\n",
    "Pollution permits and carbon taxes have a similar goal – to make companies pay for pollution and encourage them to pollute less. Both methods can increase the cost of producing pollution. Graphs show how a tax or permits can push up prices, making companies think twice about polluting.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Challenges of Pollution Permits:**\n",
    "However, using pollution permits isn't always straightforward. It's hard to figure out how many permits to give out. It's also tricky to measure pollution levels accurately. Some worry that companies might hide how much they pollute or move production to places with weaker environmental rules. There are also costs to set up and run these permit systems. And in a globalized world, richer countries can sometimes buy permits from poorer countries, which doesn't really solve the pollution problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real-World Examples:**\n",
    "One successful example was the US sulfur trading scheme in 1990. It reduced sulfur dioxide emissions by 40% by gradually reducing the permits. But some argue that simpler rules in other countries helped too. China is also planning a big pollution permit system, learning from what worked and didn't work in other places.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, pollution permits are like permission slips for companies to pollute a bit, but they have to pay for it. The goal is to make companies think about how much they're polluting and find cleaner ways to do business.\n",
